# Three Languages, One Keyboard

Welcome! I’m solving problems daily in **Python**, **Java**, and **C++** — because I teach all three languages and I am constantly screwing up which syntax goes with which language. So now I will never screw up again, all thanks to GitHub!

## Current Mission: 31-Day Challenge  
Solving the same problem in all three languages every day:  
- ✅ Python — fast, clean, no excuses  
- ✅ Java — structured, strict, predictable  
- ✅ C++ — efficient, unforgiving, keeps you sharp
