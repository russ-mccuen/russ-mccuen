# Four Languages, One Keyboard

Welcome! I’m solving problems daily in **Python**, **Java**, **C++**, and **Rust**! I teach three of the languages (all but Rust) and I am constantly screwing up which syntax goes with which language. So now I will never screw up again, all thanks to GitHub!

## Current Mission: 31-Day Challenge  
Solving the same problem in all four languages every day:  
- Python — fast, clean, no excuses  
- Java — structured, strict, predictable  
- C++ — efficient, unforgiving, keeps you sharp
- Rust - because I know a Rust fanatic and I am curious if it is as awesome as the fanatic says it is
